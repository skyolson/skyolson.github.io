In *Campaign Office* (2016), I worked with people who passed through the gallery and filmed them as they re-delivered politicians’ campaign speeches. The speeches given by participants are subtle performances of them wrestling with the contradictions—and at times meaninglessness—of the speeches, and of them conveying their feelings about the words that they are speaking. Campaign Office was presented within a functioning DIY television studio at Smack Mellon Gallery, complete with a green screen, studio lighting and a plywood office.
