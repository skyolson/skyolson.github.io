*gender.network* is a growing digital archive of flyers, photos, artwork, cartoons, letters, poems, ephemera, and other visual culture from the 1960s-90s, created by trans\*, two-spirit, nonbinary, and trans-adjacent activists, organizers, and artists.  The curation of this archive has been guided by hundreds of conversations and interviews with trans and queer elders, community members, archivists, and scholars. It currently focuses on 1960s-1990s North America. You can help build and shape this archive too — please contact us or submit material at <a href="mail@gender.network">mail@gender.network</a> or join us at one of our upcoming workshops to help curate, notate, and edit what is here, and help identify what is not!
