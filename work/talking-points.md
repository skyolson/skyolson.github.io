*Three-channel digital video*

Talking Points is a political “still life,” in which the staging  and affective performances of US politics are brought to the foreground. It is a three channel video, each of which is an editing of C-SPAN footage so that it appears no one speaks. The original footage comes  from: a press conference by Obama honoring the death of Nelson Mandela;  Chase president Jamie Dimon appearing before the Senate Banking  Committee; and a meeting of the Joint Chiefs of Staff as they are  questioned about sexual abuse in the military.
