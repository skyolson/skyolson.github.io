## The Invisible Hand (2021)

*Single channel digital video, 45 minutes*

*The Invisible Hand* (2021) is an experimental documentary  that foregrounds the usually invisible labor of a government building’s  cleaning crew. The film follows the cleaners of the Gouvernement aan de  Maas in Maastricht, Netherlands, the site of the treaty that established the European Union in 1992. Created improvisationally and in  collaboration with several of the cleaners—Abdul, Esther, Irene, Josje,  Kiona, Peter, and Velasca—the film captures their daily routines as they polish the building’s marble and glass surfaces and tidy up after  politicians and office staff. 

The film is an intimate portrait of the cleaning crew and a journey  through the epic landscape of the building itself. The camera never  leaves the Gouvernement, following the cleaners’ often solitary labor  and documenting their brief encounters with one another and with other  building staff. While Olson’s camera maintains an observational  distance, its presence is a frequent topic of conversation by the  cleaners and staff, dialogue that reveals power dynamics and hierarchies at play within the building. At other times, the camera takes the  vantage point of the cleaning machinery itself, floating just above its  gleaming floors or bouncing down its corridors.
