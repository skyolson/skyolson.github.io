# Workshop description:

> “Gender does not need to organize social arrangements, including social sexual arrangements. [And] gender arrangements need not be either heterosexual or patriarchal. They need not be, that is, as a matter of history. . . ”

<p align="right"><em>María Lugones, The Coloniality of Gender</em></p>

Tthis workshop approaches the question “why are there two genders?” from a historical and decolonial perspective. We will begin by discussing María Lugones’ essay *The Coloniality of Gender,* which presents a framework for understanding the modern gender system as part of a larger system of power that also manifests as racism, settler colonialism, and capitalism, among other things.

Jumping off from Lugones’ text, we will discuss several historical examples of non-binary, non-patriarchal gendered social roles, expressions and identities in order to emphasize the long historical timeline that we are working with and to focus our attention on both structures of oppression and forms of resistance. 

Prior knowledge or experience with this material is not required, but participants are asked to come with a willingness to challenge conventional understandings of gender and sex, and to explore the intersections of these categories with racist and imperialist oppression.

We will also be turning inwards and towards each other to build our awareness of our gender embodiment and share our experiences. This workshop also draws from malcolm shanks’ and khari jackson’s zine [*Decolonizing Gender*](https://www.decolonizinggender.com/the-zine), and is deeply indebted to shanks’ and jackson’s brilliance, generosity, and labor.

# Objectives:

-	Discuss a solidarity-centered framework for understanding gender-based oppression as part of larger systems of racist, colonial, imperialist, and capitalist power.
-	Learn about individuals and cultures who have expressed, experienced, or understood gender in ways that resist or refuse our binary, essentialist, patriarchal, and hierarchical framework.
-	Reflect on our lived and embodied experiences of gender and practice conversations about gender from a decolonial perspective.
