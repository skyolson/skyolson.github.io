# Workshop description:

> “Gender does not need to organize social arrangements, including social sexual arrangements. [And] gender arrangements need not be either heterosexual or patriarchal. They need not be, that is, as a matter of history. . . ”

<p align="right"><em>María Lugones, The Coloniality of Gender</em></p>

This workshop approaches the question “why are there two genders?” from historical, decolonial, and embodied perspectives. Prior knowledge or experience with gender studies and decolonial theory is not required, but participants are asked to come with a willingness to challenge conventional understandings of gender and sex, and to explore the intersections of these categories with racist and imperialist oppression.

As Lugones’ quotation above suggests, numerous historical and contemporary manifestations of non-binary gender relations, including the contemporary categories of transgender and intersex under the LGBTQIA umbrella[^1], throw into question assumptions made about gender and sex—assumptions that are now in many ways global and which cross social, cultural, legal, and political realms. 

This workshop begins with a discussion of several historical examples of non-binary gender expressions and identities in order to emphasize the long historical timeline that we are working with and to focus our attention on both structures of oppression and forms of resistance. We will then turn to María Lugones’ essay The Coloniality of Gender as a framework for understanding the modern gender system through the intersectional, entangled oppressions of gender, race, and class. 

We will also be turning inwards and towards each other to build our awareness of our gender embodiment and share experiences of patriarchal, racist, classist, and transgender oppressions from a decolonial perspective. We will be drawing extensively from malcolm shanks’ and khari jackson’s zine Decolonizing Gender. This workshop structure and its curriculum are deeply indebted to shanks’ and jackson’s brilliance, generosity, and labor.

# Objectives:

-	Discuss several historical examples of individuals and cultures who expressed non-binary, multiple, or other forms of gender, and who understood gender relations in non-patriarchal or egalitarian forms.  
-	Introduce a solidarity-centered framework for understanding oppression that involves intersections of gender, race, colonialism, and capitalism.
-	Connect an understanding of the modern gender system to our lived and embodied experiences of gender and practice conversations about gender from a decolonial perspective.
