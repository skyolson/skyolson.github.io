Sky Syzygy is a multidisciplinary artist, radical archivist, and a community organizer and facilitator. Her work seeks to celebrate and honor the individuals, groups, and events that have made our lives possible, and to focus special attention on the behind-the-scenes work, intersections, and small gestures that nourish our movements, build our capacity to organize, and allow us to thrive. Syzygy's artwork draws on techniques of printmaking, documentary filmmaking, and choreography for working in collaboration with individuals and their communities.

In 2021, Sky launched gender.network, an archive of flyers, photos, artwork, cartoons, letters, poems, and other media by trans\*, Two-spirit, nonbinary, and trans-adjacent activists, organizers, and artists. In 2024, a selection of these materials was published as an artist book, *gender liberators*, by Women's Studio Workshop. This project has received funding from the Mellon Foundation, Humanities New York, New York State Council on the Arts, Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, and the Puffin Foundation. 

Sky has an MFA from The New School, a degree in physics from Harvard, and performed as a dancer in the US and internationally for over a decade. She is an A.I.R. Gallery member and has been a resident at Women's Studio Workshop, the Jan Van Eyck Academie, the Art & Law Program, and Mass MoCA, among others. Her artwork is in collections across the US, and has been exhibited in group shows and festivals in the US, Canada, Europe, and Australia.
