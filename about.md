Sky Syzygy is a white queer trans femme filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist, a racial and gender justice facilitator, and a data scientist. Her work focuses attention on minor gestures, tactile points of contact, and ideological forces. She draws on techniques of choreography, documentary theater, and movement building and facilitation for working in collaboration with individuals and communities who are not usually the focus, seeking to move past the canonical, official aspects of a history to work with and acknowledge the individuals and events that are not usually the subjects of attention. 

Sky received an MFA from The New School, a degree in physics from Harvard, and performed as a dancer in the US and internationally for over a decade. She has been in residence or a fellow at AIR Gallery, the Jan Van Eyck Academie, the Art &amp; Law Program, Mass MoCA, the Atlantic Center, the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center, and NARS Foundation. She is a data analyst at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and a racial justice trainer and facilitator with Race Forward. Her videos and installations have been exhibited in group shows and festivals in North America, Europe, and Australia.
