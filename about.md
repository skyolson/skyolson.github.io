Sky Syzygy is a white queer trans femme film and installation maker and multidisciplinary artist, a racial justice facilitator, and a data scientist. Her work pulls focus on the politics of organizations and the micropolitics of lived experience, illuminating what is normally in the background, what we have been trained not to see or to acknowledge. Attending to minor gestures, hidden trends, tactile points of contact, ideological forces, and the fight for individual and collective agency and dignity, she draws out the choreographic, the gender-fuck, and the quietly and deeply personal as forms of resistance.

Sky received an MFA from The New School, a degree in physics, and performed as a dancer in the US and internationally for over a decade. She has been in residence or a fellow at AIR Gallery, the Jan Van Eyck Academie, the Art &amp; Law Program, Mass MoCA, the Atlantic Center, the Kimmel Harding Nelson Center, and NARS Foundation. She is a data analyst at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and a racial justice trainer and facilitator with Race Forward. Her videos and installations have been exhibited in group shows and festivals in North America, Europe, and Australia.
